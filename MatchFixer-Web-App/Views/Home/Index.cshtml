	<h3>Bet responsibly</h3>
	<p>At MatchFixer, we’re all about good vibes, clever predictions, and having fun — but we take responsible betting seriously.

	We encourage every user to treat betting as entertainment, not a source of income. Betting should never feel like pressure, a solution to financial problems, or something that causes stress. If it does, it’s time to take a breather.

	Here are a few golden rules we stand by:

	<p>🎯 Set a budget — and stick to it.</p>
	<p>⏳ Take breaks — the game will still be there.</p>
	<p>❌ Don’t chase losses — that’s a fast road to regret.</p>
	<p>👀 Know the odds — and understand the risks.</p>
	<p>🧘 Keep your cool — if it’s not fun, it’s not worth it.</p>
	<p>If you ever feel like things are getting out of hand, there’s no shame in reaching out. We support self-exclusion tools, and we’re here to point you to helpful resources any time.</p>
	<p>⚖️ Bet smart. Bet safe. Stay in control.</p>
	<p>Because no match is worth losing yourself over.</p>
